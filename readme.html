      <p>Requirements

    The goal of this project was to make a personal website. I chose to create a showcase website that I could show potential employers. This web site contains many of the lessons I have learned in CS50.
	    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    The project requirements are:
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    1. The website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
	      <p>The site uses 4 html pages: index.html, hello.html, mystyle.html, and readme.html. <p>  
	      <p>At the bottom of each page is a link that returns to the parent page.<p>  
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    2. The website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
	     <p>The site has 1 ordered and 1 unordered list example. There is one table. There are 2 images (1 local and 1 wiki image) <p>  
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    3. The website must have at least one stylesheet file.
	    <p>The site uses 1 style sheet for hello.html named mystyle.css <p>  
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    4. The stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. It must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    5. The stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    6. Bootstrap 4 must be used on the website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    7. the stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    8. README.md must include a short writeup describing the project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about the project.
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
